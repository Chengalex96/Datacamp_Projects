To reveal the main topics from app reviews, you'll perform these tasks:

Preprocess the negative reviews (reviews with a score of 1 or 2) by tokenizing the text, removing stop words and non-alpha characters. Save the results in a pandas DataFrame called preprocessed_reviews.
Vectorize the cleaned negative reviews using TF-IDF and store the matrix in a variable called tfidf_matrix.
Apply K-means clustering to tfidf_matrix to group the reviews into five categories. Store the predicted labels in a list called categories.
For each unique cluster label, find the most frequent term. Store the results in a pandas DataFrame called topic_terms with at least three columns to store the label assigned from K-means, the identified term, and its frequency.
