You have been asked to support on a machine learning project with the aim of building a pipeline to predict the climate in London, England. Specifically, the model should predict mean temperature in degrees Celsius (°C).\n\nSince the weather depends on a lot of different factors, you will want to run a lot of experiments to determine what the best approach is to predict the weather. In this project, you will run experiments for different regression models predicting the mean temperature, using a combination of `sklearn` and `mlflow`.\n\nYou will be working with data stored in `london_weather.csv`, which contains the following columns:\n- **date** - recorded date of measurement - (**int**)\n- **cloud_cover** - cloud cover measurement in oktas - (**float**)\n- **sunshine** - sunshine measurement in hours (hrs) - (**float**)\n- **global_radiation** - irradiance measurement in Watt per square meter (W/m2) - (**float**)\n- **max_temp** - maximum temperature recorded in degrees Celsius (°C) - (**float**)\n- **mean_temp** - **target** mean temperature in degrees Celsius (°C) - (**float**)\n- **min_temp** - minimum temperature recorded in degrees Celsius (°C) - (**float**)\n- **precipitation** - precipitation measurement in millimeters (mm) - (**float**)\n- **pressure** - pressure measurement in Pascals (Pa) - (**float**)\n- **snow_depth** - snow depth measurement in centimeters (cm) - (**float**)","metadata":{},"id":"21503acd-6cbf-40a4-ad05-853a5da28fb7","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Run this cell to install mlflow\n!pip install mlflow","metadata":{},"cell_type":"code","id":"3fac012d-6719-43dc-bf15-e152678e86d9","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"source":"# Run this cell to import the modules you require\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport mlflow\nimport mlflow.sklearn\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\nfrom sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\n\n# Read in the data\nweather = pd.read_csv(\"london_weather.csv\")\n\n# Start coding here\n# Use as many cells as you like","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":634,"lastExecutedAt":1698310520129,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Run this cell to import the modules you require\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport mlflow\nimport mlflow.sklearn\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\nfrom sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor"},"cell_type":"code","id":"3976d816-6d2e-41b5-bd2f-3eac2729c5ce","execution_count":1,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
