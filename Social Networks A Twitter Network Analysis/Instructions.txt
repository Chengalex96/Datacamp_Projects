Using the Twitter dataset, you'll implement several useful functions which will aid in the analysis of Twitter's user-base.

Implement the following functions:

is_following(T, user_id1, user_id2): Returns True if user_id2 is following user_id1, else False.

get_users_following_min_accounts(T, min_following_count): Returns a list of user IDs who are following at least min_following_count accounts.

get_mutual_followees(T, user_id1, user_id2): Returns a list of user ids that user_id1 and user_id2 both follow.
