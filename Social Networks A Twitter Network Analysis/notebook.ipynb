You'll get hands-on with real Twitter follower data using Pandas, transforming it into a cool directed graph with NetworkX. Along the way, you'll learn how to spot key influencers, find out who follows who, and discover mutual connections between users.\n\n### The Data\n\n# twitter-followers.csv\n\n| Column     | Description              |\n|------------|--------------------------|\n| `'FOLLOWER'` | id of the user who is following |\n| `'FOLLOWEE'` | id of the user being followed |\n\nThroughout the project, you will manipulate and organize this data to extract meaningful insights.","metadata":{},"id":"654c6aa7-9bb5-4c7a-a22d-516f4724912b","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Imports you'll need for the project\nimport pandas as pd\nimport networkx as nx\n\n# Load csv data and store as edgelist (a directed graph)\ndf = pd.read_csv('twitter-followers.csv')\nT = nx.from_pandas_edgelist(df, 'FOLLOWER', 'FOLLOWEE', create_using=nx.DiGraph())\n\n# Display head of the DataFrame\nprint(df.head())","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":3548,"lastExecutedAt":1719516627888,"lastExecutedByKernel":"8110a833-a0f4-4e8c-852d-e07c6f77e238","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Imports you'll need for the project\nimport pandas as pd\nimport networkx as nx\n\n# Load csv data and store as edgelist (a directed graph)\ndf = pd.read_csv('twitter-followers.csv')\nT = nx.from_pandas_edgelist(df, 'FOLLOWER', 'FOLLOWEE', create_using=nx.DiGraph())\n\n# Display head of the DataFrame\nprint(df.head())","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":143,"type":"stream"}}},"id":"b7f2e82b-2acb-4a77-b073-07e6bad98c96","cell_type":"code","execution_count":14,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":"   FOLLOWER  FOLLOWEE\n0         1         2\n1         1         3\n2         1         4\n3         1         5\n4         1         6\n"}]},{"source":"# Start coding here and use as many cells as you need!","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":1477,"lastExecutedAt":1719516629365,"lastExecutedByKernel":"8110a833-a0f4-4e8c-852d-e07c6f77e238","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Returns True is `user_id2` is `following user_id1`\ndef is_following(T, user_id1, user_id2):\n    return user_id1 in T.neighbors(user_id2)\n    \n# Returns a list of user ids that are following at least `min_following_count` other users.\ndef get_users_following_min_accounts(T, min_following_count):\n    return [node for node in T.nodes() if len(list(T.neighbors(node))) >= min_following_count]\n\n# Returns a list of user ids that `user_id1` and `user_id2` both follow\ndef get_mutual_followees(T, user_id1, user_id2):\n    #
