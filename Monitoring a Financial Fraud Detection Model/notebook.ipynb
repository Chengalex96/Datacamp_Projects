London's Poundbank needs your help to figure out why their fraud detection models aren't as accurate anymore.\n\nPoundbank recommends the `nannyml` library for monitoring machine learning models, which is also their tool of choice.\n\n## The data\n\nThey have provided you with a reference(test data) and analysis set(production data). A summary and preview are provided below.\n\n## reference.csv and analysis.csv\n\n| Column     | Description              |\n|------------|--------------------------|\n| `'timestamp'` | Date of the transaction. |\n| `'time_since_login_min'` | Time since the user logged in to the app. |\n| `'transaction_amount'` | The amount of Pounds(¬£) that users sent to another account. |\n| `'transaction_type'` | Transaction type: <ul><li>`CASH-OUT` - Withdrawing money from an account.</li><li>`PAYMENT` - Transaction where a payment is made to a third party.</li><li>`CASH-IN` - This is the opposite of a cash-out. It involves depositing money into an account.</li><li>`TRANSFER` - Transaction which involves moving funds from one account to another.</li> |\n| `'is_first_transaction'` | A binary indicator denoting if the transaction is the user's first (1 for the first transaction, 0 otherwise). |\n| `'user_tenure_months'` | The duration in months since the user's account was created or since they became a member. |\n| `'is_fraud'` | A binary label indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent (1 for fraud, 0 otherwise). |\n| `'predicted_fraud_proba'` | The probability assigned by a detection model indicates the likelihood of a fraudulent transaction. |\n| `'predicted_fraud'` |  The predicted classification label is calculated based on predicted fraud probability by the detection model (1 for predicted fraud, 0 otherwise). |","metadata":{"tags":[],"collapsed":false,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false,"source_hidden":false}},"id":"35d4e17b-eeb6-40dd-a140-7b949390e115","cell_type":"markdown","attachments":{}},{"source":"# Re-run this cell to install nannyml\n!pip install nannyml","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":20165,"lastExecutedAt":1706625208181,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Re-run this cell\n!pip install nannyml-0.10.1-py3-none-any.whl","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":616,"type":"stream"}}},"cell_type":"code","id":"6871be91-94ef-450b-9445-20392be988c9","outputs":[],"execution_count":2},{"source":"# Re-run this cell\n#¬†Import required libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport nannyml as nml\nnml.disable_usage_logging()\n\nreference = pd.read_csv(\"reference.csv\")\nanalysis = pd.read_csv(\"analysis.csv\")\nreference.head()","metadata":{"outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":213,"type":"dataFrame"}},"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":4931,"lastExecutedAt":1706625228562,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Re-run this cell\n#¬†Import required libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport nannyml as nml\nnml.disable_usage_logging()\n\nreference = pd.read_csv(\"reference.csv\")\nanalysis = pd.read_csv(\"analysis.csv\")\nreference.head()"},"id":"2ca4359b-3fb7-4cfc-8017-36f70e928fba","cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"source":"#¬†Start coding here\n# Use as many cells as you need","metadata":{},"cell_type":"code","id":"49adcc93-8a83-476a-8aba-6a9aab8690eb","outputs":[],"execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"editor":"DataCamp Workspace","kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
