Help the team process their dataset of animal images in preparation for modeling.

Write a function called image_processing capable of importing and transforming multiple images, and outputting a transformed dataset of images in the form of a list. It should import images and resize, rotate, and equalize them (i.e. Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) in that order. The function will have the following parameters:

file_names: Accepts a list of strings, each a path to an image. No default value.

size: Accepts a tuple for the target resize shape, defaulting to (250,250).

rotation_angle: Accepts a numeric input for rotation degree, defaulting to 0.

equalization_clip_limit: Accept a number (0-1) for the equalization clip limit, default to None. If None, skip equalization.

Apply the image_processing function to the data and save the result as tranformed_images.

Use Matplotlib to visualize the images and verify the transformations.
