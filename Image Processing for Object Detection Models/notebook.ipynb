The footage needs to be examined to find out when animals have been captured in the footage. Classifying all captured images based on whether the feature animals could save weeks of work. \n\nYou are part of a data science team involved in making this documentary, and your task is to prepare an image processing pipeline. The pipeline will augment existing datasets of images featuring animals so that an object-detection model can be trained and used on the footage.\n\nData augmentation involves creating variations of the original images through transformations like rotation, scaling, and equalizing to increase the training dataset's diversity and models' robustness. This technique enriches the dataset without collecting more data, helping models generalize better to new, unseen images.\n\nIn this project, you will perform image processing operations on five images featuring animals. The output of this project will be a pipeline transforming images to produce augmented datasets.\n\n## Data\n\nThe `COCO` (Common Objects in Context) dataset is a dataset designed for training and evaluating computer vision models on a variety of tasks, including object detection. Five images featuring animals have been downloaded from this dataset. \n\nThe list `file_names` is already available and contains the names of the image files available in the current directory.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3fbd32a9-f9f5-46bb-aec8-9094d9ccb25f"},{"source":"# Import Matplotlib to read and display images \nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Import the necessary modules from scikit-image for image transformation, and exposure adjustment\nfrom skimage.transform import resize, rotate \nfrom skimage.exposure import equalize_adapthist\n\n# List of filenames for the images to be processed\nfile_names = [\"000000546829.jpg\",\"000000012062.jpg\",\"000000417085.jpg\",\"000000269314.jpg\",\"000000575357.jpg\"]","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":682,"lastExecutedAt":1712672984730,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Import Matplotlib to read and display images \nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Import the necessary modules from scikit-image for image transformation, and exposure adjustment\nfrom skimage.transform import resize, rotate \nfrom skimage.exposure import equalize_adapthist\n\n# List of filenames for the images to be processed\nfile_names = [\"000000546829.jpg\",\"000000012062.jpg\",\"000000417085.jpg\",\"000000269314.jpg\",\"000000575357.jpg\"]","lastExecutedByKernel":"c4533f37-b7aa-4d9c-9666-301f90c00df7"},"cell_type":"code","id":"c57300f8-eb53-42d4-ae03-5b0cac8ddafb","outputs":[],"execution_count":1},{"source":"# Start coding here\n# Use as many cells as you need","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":10,"lastExecutedAt":1712672985278,"lastExecutedByKernel":"c4533f37-b7aa-4d9c-9666-301f90c00df7","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Start coding here\n# Use as many cells as you need"},"cell_type":"code","id":"96741a3f-1e3e-4366-a3c1-c12703f09cb7","outputs":[],"execution_count":2}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
