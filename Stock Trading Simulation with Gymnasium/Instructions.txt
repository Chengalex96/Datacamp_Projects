Create and train a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) model using the provided environment. Train this model for a total_timesteps of 10000. Implement the trading logic to make buy, sell, or hold decisions based on the model's predictions.

Adjust the cash balance and shares_held based on the action taken (buy/sell) and allow the model to trade a certain percentage of its balance each step.
Monitor balance changes and store the history in balance_history for visualization.
If shares are still held at the end, sell them to update the final balance.
By the end of this project you should have two charts that display the performance of the model.

Chart 1 should show the stock price with buy/sell actions overlaid on the price.
Chart 2 should show the cash balance over time.
Questions:

What do you think about the performance of this model?
Why do you think it has performed the way it has?
How could the data we have selected impact the performance of the model?
