However, their effectiveness can be hindered by various factors, such as their visibility under different lighting conditions or the presence of obstructions.\n\n\n**Training Traffic Sign Detection Models**\n\nTo address these challenges and enhance stop sign and traffic light detection capabilities, advanced technologies such as deep learning and computer vision have gained significant attention. In this project, you'll train an object detection model on 6 images of stop signs and 6 images of traffic lights, taken from various angles and lighting conditions. This training teaches the model to classify and locate these signs in images, improving its robustness and reliability for real-world applications.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"1c2bc1d6-3780-4d6f-8016-c90898817887"},{"source":"# Import required libraries\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom tensorflow import keras\n\n# Load preprocessed images and the corresponding labels\nimage, labels = np.load('batch.npy',allow_pickle=True).tolist()\n\n# hyperparameters\ninput_size = image.shape[1] # dimension of input image\nnum_classes = labels['classifier_head'].shape[1] # number of classes\nDROPOUT_FACTOR = 0.2 # dropout probability\n\n# visualize one example preprocessed image\nplt.imshow(image[2])\nplt.axis(\"off\")","cell_type":"code","id":"2f26fc58-2bcd-45a6-841f-cbcdd391e2f2","outputs":[],"metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":4430,"lastExecutedAt":1713276629446,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Import required libraries\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom tensorflow import keras\n\n# Load a batch of data\nimage, labels = np.load('batch.npy',allow_pickle=True).tolist()\n\n# hyperparameters\ninput_size = image.shape[1] # dimension of input image\nnum_classes = labels['classifier_head'].shape[1] # number of classes\nDROPOUT_FACTOR = 0.2 # dropout probability\n","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":616,"type":"stream"},"1":{"height":185,"type":"stream"}},"lastExecutedByKernel":"5a0f4d15-6907-4f28-beba-20c3ed09e18c"},"execution_count":1},{"source":"# Start coding here\n# Use as many cells as you need","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":46,"lastExecutedAt":1712258220852,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":""},"cell_type":"code","id":"84cdd85c-afb2-4f4f-b66c-8b158eeac8d2","outputs":[],"execution_count":1}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
