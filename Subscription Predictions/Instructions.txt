How many total Fintech and Crypto clients does the company have? Store as an integer variable called total_fintech_crypto_clients.
Which industry has the highest renewal rate? Store as a string variable called top_industry.
For clients that renewed their subscriptions, what was the average inflation rate when their subscriptions were renewed? Store as a float variable called average_inflation_for_renewals.
